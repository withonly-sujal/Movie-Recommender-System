# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

This is a **Movie Recommender System** project developed as part of my IBM course on Machine Learning and AI. The project demonstrates how to build a basic content-based movie recommendation engine using Python and essential data science libraries.

It is designed to recommend similar movies based on user input by comparing movie metadata like genres, keywords, and more.
